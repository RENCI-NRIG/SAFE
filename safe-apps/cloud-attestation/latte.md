# Latte Kubernetes (L-Kube)

The L-Kube documentation illustrates scenarios for creating, checking,
and using of services running in pods launched from Latte Kubernetes.
It explains how code and configuration of a pod are attested using
Latte, how properties of a pod service are drawn based on endorsements
and policies, and how L-Kube is integrated to enable
attestation-based access control in applications, e.g., joint data
analytics.
